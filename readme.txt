Hello,

this is a simple to-do list builder with determining the importance of the task, and with a countdown of days from the creation of the task.

in a simple console menu, you can choose:
>to create a job,
>delete a job, 
>view saved jobs,
>and close the program.

the file with tasks is in pickle format and it is saved locally on the machine, or it is created if not exist.


Martin.
